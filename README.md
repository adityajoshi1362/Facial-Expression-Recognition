# FACIAL-EXPRESSION-
😊 Facial Expression Recognition with Deep Learning
Welcome to the Facial Expression Recognition project! This repository showcases a powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify human emotions from facial images. Using the FER2013 dataset, the model detects seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. Ready to dive into the world of emotion detection? Let's get started! 🚀
✨ Project Highlights
This Jupyter Notebook (facial-expression-recognization_by_feedback.ipynb) is your gateway to building an emotion recognition system. Here's what it does:

Data Magic: Loads and preprocesses the FER2013 dataset, transforming raw pixels into 48x48 grayscale images with normalization and augmentation for robust training.
Smart Architecture: Features a CNN with residual connections, convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout for top-notch performance.
Training Power: Trains the model with a train-validation split, optimizing for accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC using the Adam optimizer.
Insightful Evaluation: Produces detailed classification reports and a vibrant confusion matrix visualization to understand model performance.
Real-World Prediction: Demonstrates single-image predictions, showing how the model interprets emotions with confidence scores.

🛠️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
You'll need Python and a few packages to bring this project to life:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn opencv-python

Download the FER2013 dataset (fer2013.csv) from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
Installation

Clone this repo and step into the future of emotion detection:
git clone https://github.com/adityajoshi1362/facial-expression-recognition.git
cd facial-expression-recognition


(Optional) Set up a virtual environment to keep things tidy:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure fer2013.csv is in the project folder.

Fire up Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook


Open facial-expression-recognization_by_feedback.ipynb and run the cells to witness the magic!


🎮 How to Use

Run the Notebook: Execute the cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results. Enjoy the colorful confusion matrix and detailed metrics!
Tweak and Experiment:
Play with hyperparameters like batch_size (64), epochs (50), or the learning rate (0.0001) to boost performance.
Adjust data augmentation in ImageDataGenerator (e.g., rotation, zoom) for creative preprocessing.


Predict Emotions: Test the model on new images by preprocessing them to 48x48 grayscale and normalized format. Check out the sample prediction for inspiration!

📊 The FER2013 Dataset
The FER2013 dataset is a treasure trove of 35,887 grayscale images (48x48 pixels), each labeled with one of seven emotions:

0: Angry 😣
1: Disgust 😖
2: Fear 😨
3: Happy 😄
4: Sad 😢
5: Surprise 😲
6: Neutral 😐

The notebook splits the data into training and validation sets, but you can extend it to include the test set for further evaluation.
🌟 Model Performance
After training for 50 epochs, the model delivers:

A detailed classification report with precision, recall, and F1-scores for each emotion.
A visually stunning confusion matrix to spot where the model shines or needs a nudge.
Example predictions, like correctly identifying a "Neutral" expression with high confidence.

🔮 What's Next?
Take this project to the next level with these ideas:

Go Deeper: Experiment with advanced architectures or pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for better accuracy.
Balance Emotions: Tackle class imbalance with weighted loss or oversampling techniques.
Real-Time Fun: Add webcam support with OpenCV for live emotion detection.
Hyperparameter Hunt: Use Keras Tuner or grid search to find the perfect settings.
